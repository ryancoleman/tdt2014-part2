                             FILTER PROGRAM

           THIS PROGRAM FILTERS ATOMIC COORDINATE FILES
             BASED ON DISTANCE AND SEQUENCE CRITERIA


name of file to filter by -
 xtal-lig.pdb                                                                    
 filter by atom names or numbers in receptor(na/nu)?
 residue/ligand orientation number increment filter?
  -100000
 Filter for MS run?(Y/N)
 Y                                                                               
 Either names or numbers of the atoms to filter by, as 
 they appear in the pdb, with boolean and/or operators 
 if such apply between them.  Maximum of one boolean 
 per two filter atoms.
 name of ligand file-
 rec.pdb                                                                         
 names of ligand atoms to match against receptor 
 filters.  Include boolean and/ors between EACH 
 atom specified.
